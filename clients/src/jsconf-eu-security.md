Security todo:
- get Key Vault video from Tanya, add blurb in docs about easy way with env variable, and proper way with key Vault
- Manual auth token on page, auto-generate and allow their own
- Update getting started repo to have token comparison code
- Turn on logging
- CDA Global Demos is really insecure...move elsewhere and manually add others to IAM
